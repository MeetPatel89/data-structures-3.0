# Data Structures and Algorithms

Welcome to the data structues and algorithms docs.

## Nodes

Nodes are the fundamental building blocks of many computer science data structures. They are used to construct more complex data structures such as linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, etc.

### What is a node?
An individual node contains data and links to other nodes. You can add additional constraints or methods to these features depending on the data structure being constructed.

## Recursion

When you call a function or method from within that function or method.

## Complexity

Determining the efficiency of programs using Big O notation for space-time complexity.
