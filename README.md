# Data Structures and Algorithms

Welcome to the data structues and algorithms docs.

## Nodes

Nodes are the most fundamental of all data structures. They are used to build many other complex data structures.

## Recursion

When you call a function or method from within that function or method.

## Complexity

Determining the efficiency of programs using Big O notation for space-time complexity.
